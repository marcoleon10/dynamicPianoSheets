# dynamicPianoSheets

Java oriented program that uses serialization and threads. The goal of this is to let the user create its own piano sheet with a dynamic interface that allows them to add notes and play them, and save them with serialization.

The main interface is the next one:

Three options must display:
-Serialize it: Will save locally each of the notes previously clicked within the piano sheet.
-Restore: Will clean the interface taking off all the notes in the piano sheet, and adding up the ones who were previously serialized.
-Play it!: A new interface will pop up to simulate a piano with its keys, and automatically play the song recorded in the piano sheet.
